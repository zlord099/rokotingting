# Discord Mass DM Script

## Overview

This is a Python-based Discord automation script that enables sending direct messages to multiple users through self-botting. The application uses the `discord.py-self` library to interact with Discord's API using a personal user account rather than a bot account.

**Critical Warning**: This application violates Discord's Terms of Service and poses significant risks including account suspension, permanent bans, and potential legal consequences.

## System Architecture

### Core Architecture
- **Language**: Python 3.11+
- **Primary Framework**: discord.py-self (unofficial Discord API wrapper)
- **Architecture Pattern**: Single-threaded asynchronous application
- **Configuration**: JSON-based configuration management
- **Logging**: File and console-based logging system

### Application Structure
```
├── main.py          # Main application entry point
├── utils.py         # Utility functions and helpers
├── config.json      # Configuration settings
├── users.txt        # Target users list
├── logs/            # Generated log files
└── pyproject.toml   # Python project dependencies
```

## Key Components

### 1. Main Application (`main.py`)
- **DiscordMassDM Class**: Core application logic
- **Async Client Management**: Discord client initialization and management
- **Message Sending Logic**: Bulk DM functionality with error handling
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in delays to mimic human behavior
- **Statistics Tracking**: Success/failure counters

### 2. Utility Functions (`utils.py`)
- **Logging Setup**: Timestamped log file creation and console output
- **Configuration Management**: JSON config loading with defaults
- **User File Parsing**: Processing user ID and username lists
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error management utilities

### 3. Configuration System (`config.json`)
- **Rate Limiting Parameters**: Min/max delays between messages
- **Retry Logic**: Maximum retry attempts for failed messages
- **Logging Configuration**: Log level and backup settings
- **Safety Features**: Rate limit delay and backup enablement

### 4. User Management (`users.txt`)
- **Flexible Input**: Support for Discord User IDs and usernames
- **Comment Support**: Ignored lines starting with #
- **Simple Format**: One user per line for easy management

## Data Flow

1. **Initialization Phase**:
   - Load configuration from `config.json`
   - Setup logging infrastructure
   - Display Terms of Service warning
   - Parse user list from `users.txt`

2. **Authentication Phase**:
   - Secure token input (environment variable or secure prompt)
   - Discord client initialization
   - Account validation and login

3. **Message Sending Phase**:
   - Iterate through user list
   - Apply random delays between messages
   - Handle rate limiting and errors
   - Log success/failure for each attempt
   - Track statistics

4. **Cleanup Phase**:
   - Generate final statistics report
   - Save logs and backup files
   - Graceful client shutdown

## External Dependencies

### Primary Dependencies
- **discord.py-self**: Unofficial Discord API wrapper for self-botting
- **aiohttp**: Async HTTP client (indirect dependency)
- **Standard Libraries**: asyncio, logging, json, random, time

### Runtime Dependencies
- **Python 3.11+**: Core runtime environment
- **Network Access**: Required for Discord API communication
- **File System**: For logs, config, and user list management

## Deployment Strategy

### Local Development
- **Environment**: Replit Python 3.11 environment
- **Execution**: Direct Python script execution via `python main.py`
- **Configuration**: Manual setup of token and user lists

### Production Considerations
- **Not Recommended**: Due to Terms of Service violations
- **Alternative Approaches**: Official Discord bot development
- **Compliance**: Use Discord's official bot framework instead

### Security Measures
- **Token Security**: Environment variable support
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in delays and retry logic
- **Logging**: Comprehensive audit trail
- **Warnings**: Clear Terms of Service violation notices
